This application is built specifically to only run on Nexus 5's that are rooted and using <a href="https://github.com/PkmX/lcamera">L Camera</a>

The idea for it originally came from <a href="https://github.com/modbrin">modbrin's</a> <a href="https://github.com/modbrin/libchanger">libchanger</a>
but I ran into issues importing his project into Android Studio so I wrote it from scratch.

I threw this project together in a few hours. Absolutely no guarantees come with this.
